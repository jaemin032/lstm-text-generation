# tfjs-vis

__tfjs-vis__ is a small library for _in browser_ visualization intended for use
with TensorFlow.js.

It's main features are:

* A set of visualizations useful for visualizing model behaviour
* A set of high level functions for visualizing objects specific to TensorFlow.js
* A way to organize visualizations of model behaviour that won't interfere with your web application

The library also aims to be flexible and make it easy for you to incorporate
custom visualizations using tools of your choosing, such as d3, Chart.js or plotly.js.

## Demos

- [Looking inside a digit recognizer](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-vis/mnist_internals/dist/index.html)

## Installation

You can install this using npm with

```
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs-vis
```

or using yarn with

```
yarn add @tensorflow/tfjs-vis
```

You can also load it via script tag using the following tag, however you need
to have TensorFlow.js also loaded on the page to work. Including both is shown
below.

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs"> </script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tensorflow/tfjs-vis"></script>
```


## Building from source

To build the library, you need to have node.js installed. We use `yarn`
instead of `npm` but you can use either.

First install dependencies with

```
yarn
```

or

```
npm install
```

Then do a build with

```
yarn build
```

or

```
npm run build
```

This should produce a `tfjs-vis.umd.min.js` file in the `dist` folder that you can
use.

## Sample Usage

```js
const data = [
  { index: 0, value: 50 },
  { index: 1, value: 100 },
  { index: 2, value: 150 },
];

// Get a surface
const surface = tfvis.visor().surface({ name: 'Barchart', tab: 'Charts' });

// Render a barchart on that surface
tfvis.render.barchart(data, surface, {});
```

This should show something like the following

## API

## Visors, Surfaces and Tabs

### visor() => Visor

Returns a singleton object with the public API of the visor. This will create
the necessary DOM elements for the visor on initialization.

Initially calling visor() will create a panel that is displayed on the right. It hovers over your pages content and shouldn't disturb the flow of your page's DOM Elements. It has some display controls and by default also supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

 * __`__ (backtick): Shows or hides the visor
 * __~__ (tilde, shift+backtick): Toggles betweeen full width and smaller width view of the visor.

The returned object has the following properties, documented here with the
prefix `visor()` and annotated with type information. You can call visor() as much as you want or store a reference to the returned object.

#### visor().el: HTMLElement

The containing `HTMLElement` for the whole visor.

#### visor().surface(options: SurfaceInfo) => Surface;

Returns a `Surface`, creating one if necessary. This is the primary container
of visualizations. Surfaces are organized onto `Tabs`.

`options` has the following structure.

```ts
{
  //The name / label of this surface
  name: string,
  // The name of the tab this surface should appear on (optional)
  tab?: string,
  // Display Styles for the surface (optional)
  styles?: StyleOptions,
}
```

StyleOptions has the following structure. All properties are optional
and generally represent css styles that will be added to the `Surface`. As these are css properties, they can be in any valid css unit e.g. `%` or `px`.

```ts
{
  width?: string;
  height?: string;
  maxWidth?: string;
  maxHeight?: string;
}
```

#### visor().isOpen() => boolean;

Returns true if the visor is currently open/visible.

#### visor().isFullscreen() => boolean;

Returns true if the visor is in fullscreen mode. Note that the visor may be in a closed state even if it is in fullscreen mode.

#### visor().open() => void;

Opens the visor.

#### visor().close() => void;

Closes the visor.

#### visor().toggle() => void;

Toggles the visor open and closed.

#### visor().toggleFullScreen() => void;

Toggles the fullscreen mode of the visor.

#### visor().setActiveTab(tabName: string) => void;

Set the currently active tab. tabName must be the name of an existing tab.

#### visor().unbindKeys() => void;

Removes the default keyboard handlers that control visor visibility.

#### visor().bindKeys() => void;

Restores the default keyboard handlers that control visor visiblity.

### Surface

A surface is the object returned by a call to visor().surface(...). It returns
an object with no methods and the following properties:

```ts
{
  //The containing HTML element for this surface
  container: HTMLElement;
  // A textual label for the surface.
  label: HTMLElement;
  // A container for plots and other renderings
  drawArea: HTMLElement;
}
```

Generally speaking you would only access `.drawArea` to add plots and other renders.

## Show Functions

This library exposes a `show` namespace that provides a number of higher level functions useful for rendering tfjs concepts. They lean towards being opinionated
rather than flexible but are generally combinations of `Renderers` (see below), so one can easily roll their own.

### Model Training Visualization

## show.history(container: Surface, history: HistoryLike,  metrics: string[], opts?: {}) => Promise<void>

Renders a `tf.Model` training 'History' or callback 'Logs'. These are useful for plotting training metrics after or during
training respectively.

* @param container A `Surface` or `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which surface to render to.
* @param history A history-like object. Either a tfjs-layers `History` object or an array of tfjs-layers `Logs` objects. `Logs` are produced by the callbacks on [model.fit](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.fit) and a `History` object is returned from [model.fit](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.fit).
* @param metrics An array of strings reprenting training metrics of a [tf.model](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.compile)
* @param opts Optional parameters for the line charts. See the opts parameter for render.linechart for details. Notably for 'accuracy' related plots the domain of the yAxis will always by 0-1, i.e. `zoomToFit` and `yAxisDomain` options are ignored.
* @param opts.zoomToFitAccuracy a boolean controlling whether to set `zoomToFit` to true on accuracy plots as well. Generally speaking` zoomToFit` is disabled for accuracy plots as that is desireable most of the time. However there may be cases, such as when doing transfer learning, where more resolution is desired. Set `zoomToFitAccuracy` to true to turn on zoomToFit for accuracy plots.


## show.fitCallbacks(container: Surface  metrics: string[], opts?: {}) => {[key: string]: (iteration: number, log: Logs) => Promise<void>}

Returns a collection of callbacks to pass to [model.fit](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.fit).
Callbacks are returned for the following events, `onBatchEnd` & `onEpochEnd`.

These callbacks will plot line charts for the metrics specified at the end of every batch
and every opoch.

See [model.fit](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.fit) for more info
on how to pass in callback functions to the training process.

* @param container A `Surface` or `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which surface to render to.
* @param metrics An array of strings representing training [metrics](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tf.Model.compile) of a [tf.model](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#class:Model)
* @param opts Optional parameters for the line charts. See the opts parameter for render.linechart for details. Notably for 'accuracy' related plots the domain of the yAxis will always by 0-1, i.e. zoomToFit and yAxisDomain options are ignored.
* @param opts.zoomToFitAccuracy a boolean controlling whether to set `zoomToFit` to true on accuracy plots as well. Generally speaking` zoomToFit` is disabled for accuracy plots as that is desireable most of the time. However there may be cases, such as when doing transfer learning, where more resolution is desired. Set `zoomToFitAccuracy` to true to turn on zoomToFit for accuracy plots.
* @param opts.callbacks Array of strings with callback names. Valid options are 'onEpochEnd' and 'onBatchEnd'. Defaults to ['onEpochEnd', 'onBatchEnd'].

## show.perClassAccuracy(container: Drawable, classAccuracy: {accuracy: number[], count: number[]}, classLabels?: string[]) => Promise<void>

Renders a per class accuracy table for classification task evaluation

* @param container A `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which
  surface to render to.

  the accuracy data. See metrics.perClassAccuracy for details on how to
  generate this object.
* @param classLabels An array of string labels for the classes in
  `classAccuracy`. Optional.

## show.confusionMatrix(container: Drawable, confusionMatrix: number[][], classLabels?: string[]) => Promise<void>

Renders a confusion matrix for classification task evaluation

Can optionally exclude the diagonal from being shaded if one wants the visual
focus to be on the incorrect classifications. Note that if the classification
is perfect (i.e. only the diagonal has values) then the diagonal will always
be shaded.

* @param container A `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which
  surface to render to.
* @param confusionMatrix A nested array of numbers with the confusion matrix
  values. See metrics.confusionMatrix for details on how to generate this.

Renders a histogram showing the distribution of all values in a tensor.

* @param container A `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which
  surface to render to.
* @param tensor a `Tensor`

## show.modelSummary(container: Drawable, model: tf.Model) => Promise<void>

Renders a summary of a `tf.Model`. Displays a table with layer information.

* @param container A `{name: string, tab?: string}` object specifying which
  surface to render to.

  * `{ headers: string[], values:  any[][] }`
  * data.headers are the column names
  * data.values is an array of arrays (one for  each row). The inner
  array length usually matches the length of data.headers else there will be
  some empty cells. Usually the values are strings or numbers, these are
  inserted as html content so html strings are also supported.

* @param container An `HTMLElement` or `Surface` in which to draw the table.
                   Note that the chart expects to have complete control over
                   the contents of the container and can clear its contents

                    compute any stats. Callers are allowed to pass in their
                    own stats as in some cases they may be able to compute
                    them more efficiently.

## Metrics

The `metrics` namespace contains a few utility functions for computing quality metrics
like accuracy or creating confusion matrices.

## metrics.confusionMatrix(labels: Tensor1D, predictions: Tensor1D, numClasses?: number, weights?: Tensor1D) => Promise<number[][]>

Computes a confusion matrix from predictions and labels. Each value in
labels and predictions should correspond to some output class. It is assumed
that these values go from 0 to numClasses - 1.

The result will be a 2D array of size numClasses * numClasses


* @param labels 1D tensor of true values
* @param predictions 1D tensor of predicted values
* @param numClasses Number of distinct classes. Optional. If not passed in
 numClasses will equal the highest number in either labels or predictions
 plus 1
* @param weights 1d tensor that is the same size as predictions.
  If weights is passed in then each prediction contributes its corresponding
  weight to the total value of the confusion matrix cell.


## metrics.perClassAccuracy(labels: Tensor1D, predictions: Tensor1D, numClasses?: number, weights?: Tensor1D) => Promise<{accuracy: number[], count: number[]}>

Computes per class accuracy between prediction and labels. Each value in labels and predictions should correspond to some output class. It is assumed that these values go from 0 to  numClasses - 1.

Returns an array of objects that each have an an `accuracy` and a `count` property for each class.

* @param labels 1D tensor of true values
* @param predictions 1D tensor of predicted values
* @param numClasses Number of distinct classes. Optional. If not passed in
 numClasses will equal the highest number in either labels or predictions
 plus 1


## metrics.accuracy(labels: Tensor, predictions: Tensor) => Promise<number>

Computes how often predictions matches labels.

* @param labels tensor of true values
* @param predictions tensor of predicted values
